# Easy Meal was A school project.

I Had to do an application using 4 types of Diagram, activity diagram, class diagram, sequence diagram and state diagram


For the backEnd I Used c# as an API, i did a local Database and for the front end I Used React JS


TO START THE PROJECT 

1. clone the repo
2. Open it in VS code or go to the location with your terminal 
3. yarn install - npm install ->  to download all the dependency 
4. yarn start - npm start -> to start locally the ui side of the project


If you didn't install the api side, you wont have any data !
